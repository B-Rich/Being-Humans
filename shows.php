                        Restored to its original 1927 condition, the
                        Jewelbox Theater holds up to 65 guests.
                        Located in the heart of Seattle’s kickass
                        Belltown on 2nd Ave. just south of Battery St.

                    The Rendezvous Jewelbox Theater<br/>
                    Sunday, April 18th<br/>
                    7:00-8:30pm<br/>
                    $10 at the door<br/>
                    Full service menu<br/>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Eat while you laugh but please, no choking as it
                    may effect the quality of the performance.  That’s
                    right, you will have a full service food and drink
                    menu at your fingertips as you enjoy the show.  So
                    come hungry, come thirsty, come bored and there
                    will be a good chance you will leave well-fed,
                    thirst-quenched and less-bored.

                    Does this look like a good venue for a date?
                    Hells yes, it does.  Go ahead, tweet that special
                    someone you’ve been casually stalking since last
                    Kwanza.  What have you got to lose, $10 (go dutch)
                    and your dignity?  Done and done.
