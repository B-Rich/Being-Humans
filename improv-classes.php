                    This is a new beginning improv class taught by
                    Stan Wells, a Seattle native who spent 30 years in
                    LA as an actor, director and teacher. There he
                    opened, The Empty Stage Comedy Theatre in 1998 and
                    created numerous improv groups and his own style
                    of improv, Clap-Ins, which has been adopted by
                    many former students and performers including:
                    "Hammer Don't Hurt 'Em" a group that features
                    performers in hit web series, The Guild, Legend of
                    Neil and Diggnation.  The Groundlings - Crazy
                    Uncle Joe Show, and long running group, The
                    Waterbrains also incorporate the Clap-In form.. He
                    directs <em>Being Humans</em> every month at The
                    Rendezvous/Jewel Box Theatre in Belltown.
