The files are processed in order.  Use the numbers in the filenames to arrange them as you see fit.

I'm sure the intended format is obvious just from looking at the existing files, but just in case:

Line 1:  Name of the cast member
Line 2:  Filename of the cast member's picture, in the 'images' directory
Rest of file:  HTML cast bio.  You probably want to make sure text is enclosed in <p> elements, to match the style of the rest of the site.

Don't let these be more than 8KB.  If they are, they're liable to get truncated.
